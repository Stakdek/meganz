Megatools itself is cool but a bit cumbersome if you want to work automated.
## Why?
Sometimes you want to make backups. Github would be great for that.
But Github forbids anything bigger than 100mb.
At Mega.nz you have 50GB free to use. There you can use this wrapper for "megatools" to manage your whole remote directory.
Once you have uploaded large files, you can even make them shareable under the web interface.

**How cool is that?**

## Requirements
`sudo apt-get install megatools`

# megadf.sh
Show your cloud storage space usage/quota

# megals.sh
List all remote files

# megamkdir.sh
Create remote directory

# megarm.sh
Remove remote file or directory

# megaput.sh
Upload individual files

# megaget.sh
Download individual files

# megadl.sh
Download file from a "public" Mega link (doesnâ€™t require login)

# megacopy.sh
